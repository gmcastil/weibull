<gmcastil> I have an observable that is known to have a functional form of
	   some f(x).  I have a bunch of observations of f at various x
	   values.  The functional form has 4 constants that determine the fit
	   of the curve to the data.  I want to perform such a fit and
	   determine those four constants.  What am I looking for to do this
	   sort of thing?					        [18:23]
<xihr> just a standard curve fit				        [18:24]
<gmcastil> i know the functional form of f(x), but i'd like to identify the
	   constants a, b, c, d that determine the fit
<gmcastil> xihr: its not linear					        [18:25]
<xihr> so?
<xihr> that's why it's called a "curve fit," not a "line fit"
<abwabwa> how to learn the drugs of physics?
<abwabwa> I wanna get high with this
<xihr> abwabwa: boring
<gmcastil> xihr: what particular technique are you referring to?        [18:26]
<PlanckWalk> gmcastil: The most common technique is just minimizing sum of
	     squared errors for the data points.
<xihr> gmcastil: least squares fitting is the most common	        [18:27]
<PlanckWalk> In some applications that's not really appropriate, but it's a
	     good first guess and there are tons of techniques for it.
<gmcastil> would both cases support using chi-squared to estimate goodness of
	   fit?							        [18:29]
<PlanckWalk> It depends upon what your noise model is
<PlanckWalk> If it's independent additive gaussian noise, then yes      [18:30]
<gmcastil> yeah, probably
<PlanckWalk> (Chi-squared is the distribution of a sum of squared normal
	     random variables)					        [18:32]
<gmcastil> if it were a different noise model, then i'd need a different
	   statistic to describe the goodness of fit correct?
<PlanckWalk> Yes
<gmcastil> for now, its probably good enough - the phenomenon isnt understood
	   well-enough to get really excited about the noise model.  2X is
	   good enough						        [18:33]
<gmcastil> so i'd want to look for references to minimizing 'sum of squared
	   errors for curve fitting' then?			        [18:34]
<xihr> google: least squares fitting				        [18:40]
<gmcastil> are least squares and sum of squared errors the same?        [18:41]
<xihr> least squares fitting means you minimize the sum of squared errors
<gmcastil> the articles i found on wolfram only referred to linear or
	   polynomial fits - what if its a more complicated function like an
	   exponential?						        [18:46]
<xihr> sure, search for derivations and you can calculate the formula yourself
<gmcastil> not sure what you mean				        [18:47]
<gmcastil> http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LeastSquaresFitting.html for example 
<xihr> the formulas for finding the least squares fit of a given function is
       derived through calculus: write down the sum of least squares with
       respect to a set of parameters, set them equal to zero, and solve
<xihr> set their derivatives equal to zero*
<xihr> gmcastil: that pages shows a derivation			        [18:48]
<gmcastil> eqn 3
<gmcastil> so follow the same algorithm, but with a different f(a, b)....like
	   f(a, b, c, d)
<xihr> gmcastil: yep						        [18:49]
<gmcastil> right on, thanks
<xihr> if your fitting function is common enough, you can just try googling
       for people who have already done that ... if not, you'll have to do it
       yourself
<xihr> ... or just use a CAS
<gmcastil> xihr: yeah, i could actually just use scipy to do it i think
								        [18:50]
<gmcastil> thanks i'll hack on it a while			        [18:52]
