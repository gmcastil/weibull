Weibull Fitter
==============

Weibull Fitter is a set of tools for calculating SEE Weibull parameters obtained from experimental data.

Features
--------

* Perform Weibull fit to cross section data

* Goodness of fit determined by minimizing chi-square test statistic

* Provide GUI to interactively manipulate Weibull parameters

* Ships with an extensive test suite

Overview
--------

Computation of parameters to Weibull cumulative distribution functions is routinely performed within the radiation effects community.  This is usually done by hand using a spreadsheet application with accuracy or goodness-of-fit in the eye of the beholder.
